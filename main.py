HOW TO USE:
Drag and drop G-Code file into the same folder as this program.
Run the program.
Set the file explorer path of G-Code file to read. 
Set the file explorer path of G-Code file to write to.

Console will print:
- What lines edits were made at in both the original file and the new file
- Number of lines read
- Number of lines written
- Total number of edits made
